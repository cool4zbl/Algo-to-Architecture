# Algo to Architecture

**From solving problems to designing systems — a journey through code, abstraction patterns, and real-world architecture.**

---

## 📌 What is this?

This repo maps a structured path from algorithm problems to architectural thinking:

- ✅ Solve interview-style coding problems
- 🧠 Extract and understand core algorithmic patterns
- 🌍 Explore real-world scenarios that apply those patterns
- 🏗️ Connect to system design components and cloud-native architecture

If you've ever asked,  
> “I solved this Leetcode problem... now what?”  

This repo is for you.

## 🧭 Structure

Each folder is a **pattern** (e.g., sliding-window, union-find, prefix-sum), containing:

```
pattern-name/ 
├── notes.md # Core idea, time complexity, real-world usage 
├── problems/ # Leetcode problems with solutions and personal notes 
├── real-world/ # Real systems/scenarios using this pattern 
├── system-components/ # Architecture components related to this pattern
```


---

## 🧪 Example: Sliding Window

- Problems:
  - [239. Sliding Window Maximum](./sliding-window/problems/239-sliding-window-maximum.md)
- Real-world:
  - [Rate Limiter](./sliding-window/real-world/rate-limiter.md)
- Component:
  - API Gateway, Token Bucket, etc.

---

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- Engineers preparing for system design interviews
- Developers who want to **bridge the gap between code and system design**
- Anyone curious about how algorithmic thinking powers real-world engineering
